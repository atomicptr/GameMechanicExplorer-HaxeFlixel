# Game Mechanic Explorer - HaxeFlixel Edition

This project is based on [John Watsons - Game Mechanic Explorer](http://gamemechanicexplorer.com/) (You should check out this link, very cool). Credits for the Assets and the thoughts behind the code go to him, I've merely ported his examples to HaxeFlixel :).

A collection of concrete examples for various [game mechanics](http://www.lostgarden.com/2006/10/what-are-game-mechanics.html), algorithms, and effects. The examples are all implemented in Haxe using the HaxeFlixel game framework, but the concepts and methods are general and can be adapted to any engine. Each section contains several different examples that progress in sequence from a very basic implementation to a more advanced implementation.
