			<h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Basic movement</h4>
			<p class="list-group-item-text">This is an example of Asteroids-style motion. The ship moves in straight lines until the engine is turned on and accelerates. 
			When the ship reaches any of the stage boundaries it is repositioned to the opposite side.</p>

		<a class="list-group-item" href="with-drag/">
			<h4 class="list-group-item-heading">With drag</h4>
			<p class="list-group-item-text">The ship now has a DRAG component. DRAG works by applying a velocity in the opposite direction of the ship movement whenever 
			the ship is not accelerating. This causes the ship to slow down gradually when the engine is off.</p>
