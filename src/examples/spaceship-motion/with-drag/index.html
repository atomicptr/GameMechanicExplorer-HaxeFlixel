Use the left and right arrow keys or tap near the edges to rotate the ship. Press the up arrow key or tap the center to turn on the engine.<br/>

The ship now has a DRAG component. DRAG works by applying a velocity in the opposite direction of the ship movement whenever the ship is not accelerating. 
This causes the ship to slow down gradually when the engine is off.
