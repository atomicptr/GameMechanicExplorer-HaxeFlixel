Click or tap to fire an artillery shell. Hold to fire multiple shots.<br/>

This example introduces a function getExplosion() which either creates a new explosion object or re-uses one 
that was created earlier. This approach allows the number of explosion sprites to increase dynamically but 
never creates more than are needed to display on screen at any one time.
